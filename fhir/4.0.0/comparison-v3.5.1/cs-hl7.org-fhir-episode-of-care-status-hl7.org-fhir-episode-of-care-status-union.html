<h2>Union of http://hl7.org/fhir/episode-of-care-status and http://hl7.org/fhir/episode-of-care-status</h2>

<p>
  This is the CodeSystem that contains all the codes in Episode Of Care Status (http://hl7.org/fhir/episode-of-care-status) and Episode Of Care Status (http://hl7.org/fhir/episode-of-care-status). E.g. what you have to deal with if you get resources containing codes in either of them
