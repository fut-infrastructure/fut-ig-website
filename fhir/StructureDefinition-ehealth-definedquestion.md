# Introduction

The ehealth-definedquestion profile of StructureDefinition represents the concept of a DefinedQuestion. A DefinedQuestion is a standalone representation of a question and possibly its answer options that can be used in one or more Questionnaire resources. Although a Questionnaire can be constructed without being based on any DefinedQuestion, it is expected that a catalogue of DefinedQuestion will emerge over time and the particular DefinedQuestion will be reused in multiple Questionnaire.

The DefinedQuestion concept is based on ideas described in `https://www.hl7.org/fhir/stu3/questionnaire.html#2.38.5.4`. Whether a DefinedQuestion is referenced in a Questionnaire or not, it is the Questionnaire's own definition which takes precedence.

# Scope and Usage

In the eHealth Infrastructure, a reference to a DefinedQuestion by `url` in a Questionnaire question is used to enable robust extraction in automated processing rule(s) of answer(s) to that question from corresponding QuestionnaireResponse. An answer in a QuestionnaireResponse is already unambiguously related to a question in a Questionnaire through the question's `linkId`. If the same question is used in another Questionnaire it will likely end up with a different `linkId` in that Questionnaire. By referencing a DefinedQuestion by its `url` in `Questionnaire.item.definition`, the same question can be referenced unambiguously in multiple Questionnaire.

Multiple DefinedQuestion with identical `url` can coexist as long as they have differing business versions in `version`. This way, different versions of the same question can have different answer options.

When using a DefinedQuestion in a Questionnaire, the `Questionnaire.item.definition` element must contain the `url` followed by a pipe and the business version thereby referencing a versioned DefinedQuestion.

An automated processing rule captured in a Library resource can, when extracting answer(s) to the question in a QuestionnaireResponse, choose to search for either the versioned reference or the version-less reference to a DefinedQuestion. The latter can be obtained by disregarding the pipe and business version in the rule logic.

The actual details of the DefinedQuestion's question and possible answers are described in the `ElementDefinition` found in either `snapshot.element` or `differential.element`.
