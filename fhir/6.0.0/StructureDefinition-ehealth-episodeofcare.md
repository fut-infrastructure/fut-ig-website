# Introduction

An EpisodeOfCare is an association between a patient and an organization / healthcare provider(s) during which time encounters may occur.

# Scope and Usage

In scope of the eHealth infrastructure, creation of an EpisodeOfCare resource is triggered by a number of actions taking place out-of-band, that is, outside the scope of the eHealth infrastructure. Firstly, a patient is diagnosed with one or more conditions; then assessed as fulfilling criteria for enrollment in a telemedical care program leading to a referral being made to an organization providing such program. At this point a Practitioner within the providing organization creates an EpisodeOfCare referring to the Patient and the corresponding Conditions, all in the eHealth infrastructure. Created with `status` planned, the Practitioner updates the status to active once:

* a Consent to enroll in the program has been given by the Patient
* Adjustments have possibly been made to assigned CareTeam(s) in `team`.

The EpisodeOfCare functions as a representation of a program while the activities comprising it are defined in one or more CarePlan resources.

### careManagerOrganization and managingOrganization

An EpisodeOfCare is required to have exactly one reference to the Organization responsible for the treatment through the element `ehealth-episodeofcare-caremanagerOrganization`.

The element `managingOrganization` references the Organization which is data controller for the EpisodeOfCare and all other resources directly or indirectly referencing it.

### CareTeam and history of CareTeam

The CareTeam(s) currently responsible for the EpisodeOfCare are referenced in element `team`. Changes in CareTeam references are automatically maintained in the element `ehealth-teamHistory`.
