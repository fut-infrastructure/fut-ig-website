The operation returns a 'limited' Person resource with the identifier and name of the person being the only returned attributes in the bundle. The operation is an implementation of [https://www.hl7.org/fhir/stu3/patient-operations.html#match](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/stu3/patient-operations.html#match) on the Person resource."/>
