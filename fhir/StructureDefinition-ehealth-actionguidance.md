## Resource Profile: ehealth-actionguidance 

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| *Official URL*:http://ehealth.sundhed.dk/fhir/StructureDefinition/ehealth-actionguidance | *Version*:6.0.0 |
| Active as of 2025-10-23 | *Computable Name*:ehealth-actionguidance |

# Introduction

An Action guidance expresses a set of instructions to a clinician/employee in a given situation.

# Scope and Usage

The action guidance can be associated with one or more Questionnaires, which is why it is based on questions and answers. That is, which questions and answers in an associated Questionnaire should give rise to the presentation of instructions to the clinician/employee.

The profile is based on the native FHIR Basic resource and adds the following extensions:

* `ehealth-content` The element used for the actual modeling of action guidance.
* `ehealth-basic-title` Name for this action guidance.
* `ehealth-description` A description of this action guidance.
* `ehealth-purpose` Why this action definition is defined.
* `ehealth-version` The business version of the action guidance.
* `ehealth-useContext` The context that the content is intended to support.
* `ehealth-recommendation` The recommendation level of this action guidance.
* `ehealth-intendedAudience` Can be set to one or more Organizations to indicate for which Organization(s) this action guidance is intended to be used by. This is meant for filtering and is not enforced or in any way restricting which Organization has access.
* `ehealth-actionguidance-type` Type of action guidance.
* `ehealth-actionguidance-for` A reference to a resource for which this action guidance applies.
* `ehealth-modifier-role`
* `ehealth-status`

### Governance principles

#### Properties allowed to be changed in regard to the status

* Draft 
* No restriction
 
* Active 
* **ehealth-recommendation**, **ehealth-intendedAudience**, **ehealth-useContext**, **ehealth-modifier-role** and **ehealth-status**
 
* Retired 
* **ehealth-recommendation**, **ehealth-intendedAudience**, **ehealth-useContext**, **ehealth-modifier-role** and **ehealth-status**
 

## Update restrictions

The element `ehealth-modifier-role` specifies one or more Organization and each Organization's role in maintaining the Action guidance:

* `ehealth-modifier-role.reference` references the Organization.
* `ehealth-modifier-role.role` set to `owner` means that the referenced Organization can update the resource and alter the entities referenced by `ehealth-modifier-role`, for instance, by adding more co-authors.
* `ehealth-modifier-role.role` set to `co-author` means that the referenced Organization can update the resource but not alter the element `ehealth-modifier-role`.

During an update operation, when the ActionGuidance has a status of `active` or `retired`, only the following elements are permitted to be modified: `ehealth-recommendation`, `ehealth-intendedAudience`, `ehealth-useContext`, `ehealth-modifier-role` and `ehealth-status`.

## Lifecycle

The status field,`ehealth-status`, will express the lifecycle of the resource. Changes follow this pattern.

* When created it will have status `draft`.
* From status `draft` can change to either `active` or `retired`.
* From status `active` can only change to `retired`.

### UseContext

The element `useContext` can be used to specify the context in which the ActionGuidance is applicable. The element `useContext.code` is bound to the ValueSet http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/use-context (see https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset-use-context.html) and defines the context which the `useContext` can specify. The `useContext.valueCodeableConcept` defines the value (e.g. if the `useContext.code` is `focus`, the `useContext.valueCodeableConcept` can specify a specific condition). The element `useContext.valueCodeableConcept` is validated against the eHealth ValueSet http://ehealth.sundhed.dk/vs/ehealth-usage-context-type (see https://ehealth.sundhed.dk/fhir/ValueSet-ehealth-usage-context-type.html). The validation includes that the value in `useContext.valueCodeableConcept` is acceptable in the ValueSet described for `useContext.code`.

The `useContext` element can be updated at any time, regardless of the status of the ActionGuidance.

An example of a `useContext` is that a ActionGuidance is only applicable for use in a specific intended solution (Note: the code and display for the intended solution in the example are fictional):

```
{
  "useContext": [
    {
      "code": {
        "system": "http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/use-context",
        "code": "program"
      },
      "valueCodeableConcept": {
        "system": "http://ehealth.sundhed.dk/cs/ehealth-program",
        "code": "some-intended-solution",
        "display": "Some Intended Solution"
      }
    }
  ]
}

```
