The summary table lists the resources that are part of this configuration, and for each resource it lists:

* The relevant profiles (if any)
* The interactions supported by each resource (**R**ead, **S**earch, **U**pdate, and **C**reate, are always shown, while **VR**ead, **P**atch, **D**elete, **H**istory on **I**nstance, or **H**istory on **T**ype are only present if at least one of the resources has support for them.
* The required, recommended, and some optional search parameters (if any).
* The linked resources enabled for `_include`
* The other resources enabled for `_revinclude`
* The operations on the resource (if any)
