It might be a good idea to fix to the correct version to reduce the likelihood of a wrong version being selected by an implementation/implementer, or use the [IG Parameter `pin-canonicals`](https://hl7.org/fhir/tools/CodeSystem-ig-parameters.html). Using version '1.0.0', found versions: 1.0.0, 4.0.1. Suggested fix: change the canonical reference from 'http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/data-absent-reason' to 'http://terminology.hl7.org/CodeSystem/data-absent-reason|1.0.0' (INVALID)
