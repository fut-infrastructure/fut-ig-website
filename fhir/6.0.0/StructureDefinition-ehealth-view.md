## Resource Profile: ehealth-view 

| | |
| :--- | :--- |
| *Official URL*:http://ehealth.sundhed.dk/fhir/StructureDefinition/ehealth-view | *Version*:6.0.0 |
| Active as of 2025-10-23 | *Computable Name*:ehealth-view |

# Introduction

An ehealth-view is a projection on one / several Questionnaires in relation to the display of selected questions / answers in a QuestionnaireResponse. An example of applying a questionnaire response to an interpreted view defines a projection of responses to a questionnaire. Here it refers to the questionnaire through `ehealth-view-for`.

# Scope and Usage

The profile is based on the native FHIR Basic resource and adds the following extensions:

* `ehealth-content` The element is used for the actual modeling of the view
* `ehealth-basic-title` Name for this view
* `ehealth-description` A description of this view
* `ehealth-purpose` Why this view is defined
* `ehealth-version` The business version of the view
* `ehealth-useContext` The context that the content is intended to support
* `ehealth-recommendation` The recommendation level of this view.
* `ehealth-intendedAudience` Can be set to one or more Organizations to indicate for which Organization(s) this view is intended to be used by. This is meant for filtering and is not enforced or in any way restricting which Organization has access.
* `ehealth-view-type` Type of view
* `ehealth-view-for` A reference to a resource for which this view applies
* `ehealth-modifier-role`
* `ehealth-status`

### Governance principles

#### Properties allowed to be changed in regard to the status

* Draft 
* No restriction
 
* Active 
* **ehealth-recommendation**, **ehealth-intendedAudience**, **ehealth-useContext**, **ehealth-modifier-role** and **ehealth-status**
 
* Retired 
* **ehealth-recommendation**, **ehealth-intendedAudience**, **ehealth-useContext**, **ehealth-modifier-role** and **ehealth-status**
 

## Update restrictions

The element `ehealth-modifier-role` specifies one or more Organization and each Organization's role in maintaining the View:

* `ehealth-modifier-role.reference` references the Organization.
* `ehealth-modifier-role.role` set to `owner` means that the referenced Organization can update the resource and alter the entities referenced by `ehealth-modifier-role`, for instance, by adding more co-authors.
* `ehealth-modifier-role.role` set to `co-author` means that the referenced Organization can update the resource but not alter the element `ehealth-modifier-role`.

During an update operation, when the View has a status of `active` or `retired`, only the following elements are permitted to be modified: `ehealth-recommendation`, `ehealth-intendedAudience`, `ehealth-useContext`, `ehealth-modifier-role` and `ehealth-status`.

## Lifecycle

The status field,`ehealth-status`, will express the lifecycle of the resource. Changes follow this pattern.

* When created it will have status `draft`.
* From status `draft` can change to either `active` or `retired`.

### UseContext

The element `useContext` can be used to specify the context in which the View is applicable. The element `useContext.code` is bound to the ValueSet http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/use-context (see https://hl7.org/fhir/R4/valueset-use-context.html) and defines the context which the `useContext` can specify. The `useContext.valueCodeableConcept` defines the value (e.g. if the `useContext.code` is `focus`, the `useContext.valueCodeableConcept` can specify a specific condition). The element `useContext.valueCodeableConcept` is validated against the eHealth ValueSet http://ehealth.sundhed.dk/vs/ehealth-usage-context-type (see https://ehealth.sundhed.dk/fhir/ValueSet-ehealth-usage-context-type.html). The validation includes that the value in `useContext.valueCodeableConcept` is acceptable in the ValueSet described for `useContext.code`.

The `useContext` element can be updated at any time, regardless of the status of the View.

An example of a `useContext` is that a View is only applicable for use in a specific intended solution (Note: the code and display for the intended solution in the example are fictional):

```
{
  "useContext": [
    {
      "code": {
        "system": "http://hl7.org/fhir/ValueSet/use-context",
        "code": "program"
      },
      "valueCodeableConcept": {
        "system": "http://ehealth.sundhed.dk/cs/ehealth-program",
        "code": "some-intended-solution",
        "display": "Some Intended Solution"
      }
    }
  ]
}

```
